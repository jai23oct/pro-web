                 To improve the efficiency and flight time, it was later upgraded with 810 kv motors and 10 inch propellers. Iris has served the club as well as other activities well. The datasets for image detection in DRDO SASE’s UAV Fleet Challenge were obtained from Iris.

                  Apart from improvisations, one thing focussed on by us was achieving a clean build. Space Management was a challenge and fun too. The most time consuming part was cutting wires and soldering them in places to achieve that clean build. Heat shrinks are extremely efficient and satisfying to use.</span>

                Autonomous aerial vehicles with different configurations exist to supply requirements for diverse applications. One such is the tailsitter, which gives a comparative advantage over VTOL quadcopters and fixed-wing planes.<span class = "invisible inv">Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) development is an area with rapid growth, primarily due to its low-cost, smooth operation and a desire to reduce human risk. Furthermore, these aircraft can be used in several missions, like inspection of high-risk areas, search and rescue operations in the event of accidents, environmental monitoring and precision agriculture. However, aircraft based on rotary wings suffer a penalty in performance regarding the speed of operation, which reduces the area covered in a mission. A configuration that solves this problem is the tailsitter, a fixed-wing aircraft with VTOL capabilities. Besides, flying in both hover and cruise condition, having less mechanical complexity and reduced maintenance cost are significant benefits from the operational point of view for tailsitter aircraft. The main focus of this research is the development of a small tailsitter UAV. The proposed aircraft design differs from previously tailsitters due to its simplicity and independence regarding the infrastructure for vertical takeoff and landing while still maintaining the operational benefits over similar fixed-wing and copters.</p>
                <img src="../../static/aero/css/images/tailsitter1.JPG" width="700px" height="500px">
                <p>Our paper attempts to present an uncomplicated design methodology for small autonomous battery-powered tailsitters. Subsystem parameter such as takeoff weight, power and energy consumption, and battery discharge models, would be investigated and their efficiency maximised. Feasible design space would be given by simulation with the mission and weight constraints, while the influences of wing loading and battery ratio would also be analysed. A case study would be carried out according to the design process, and then compared to previous designs to validate the results. The design methodology can be used to determine critical parameters and make necessary preparations for detailed design and vehicular realisation of small battery-powered tailsitters. 
                We would be constructing a non-vectored tailsitter aircraft, i.e., a tailsitter with fixed-rotor orientation relative to the fuselage with a large surface for extended hover authority. A non-vectored tailsitter lends much ease in manoeuvrability with keeping the design uncomplicated. </span>

						The ESCs run on DShot protocol. DShot is a new communication protocol between flight controller (FC) and ESC, substitute to Oneshot and Multishot. DShot stands for Digital Shot.Analog signals have potential issues with value accuracy because:
						Due to the possibly different speed of the oscillators (or clock) in ESC’s and FC, the length of the pulse might not be measured accurately, especially when we are talking about it’s down to the level of microseconds. Electrical noise (voltage spikes) can corrupt analog data – that’s why we sometimes see people suggest running higher motor update rate than PID loops helps flight performance.
						With digital protocol, there won’t be any of these problems. It’s exciting to know that ESC calibration will no longer be necessary. Because of the nature of digital signal, which is ones and zeros, it will also be much more resistant to electrical noise.
                        Proper Space Management is very important in these micro builds, as you can see.

					carrying a payload of 30 grams and dimensions 10cmx2cmx2cm.
			
			<span class = "invisible inv">
				Our aim is to build a quad which weighs no more than 1kg (estimated weight
                 800g) and has dimensions no bigger than 4oo*400mm. Therefore, we are
                 using a Quadcopter frame of 250mm (diagonal) and 6in props which will fit these dimensions. These motors require 3s-4s battery and draws 4A of current while hovering. We will power these motors with a 3s 3000mAh lipo battery. For controlling motor rpm, we will be using EMAX lightweight ESC’s with no Battery Eliminator Circuit (BEC). KK2.1.5 board will work as our flight controller taking inputs from receiver and giving output to the ESC’s as well as Runcam. As we have to power everything from a single lipo, power distribution board (PDB) with sufficient capacity will be used.
